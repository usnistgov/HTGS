/**
 * @enum MMType
 * @brief The memory manager types.
 * @details
 * MMType::Static
 * Indicates the static memory manager is to be used.
 * This memory manager will allocate all memory during initialization and free memory during shutdown.
 * The memory is stored in a memory pool, which is recycled based on memory rules.
 * To create this edge use the TaskGraph::addMemoryManagerEdge with MMType::Static specified
 * To get memory use ITask::memGet<type>(std::string name, IMemoryReleaseRule *rule)
 * To release memory use ITask::memRelease(std::string name, std::shared_ptr<MemoryData<V>> memory)
 *
 * MMType::Dynamic
 * Indicates the dynamic memory manager is to be used.
 * This memory manager will allocate memory from within an ITask's ITask::memGet function and the memory is
 * freed within the MemoryManager based on the memory's IMemoryReleaseRule.
 * To create this edge use the TaskGraph::addMemoryManagerEdge with MMType::Dynamic specified
 * To get memory use ITask::memGet<type>(std::string name, IMemoryReleaseRule *rule, size_t numElements)
 * To release memory use ITask::memRelease(std::string name, std::shared_ptr<MemoryData<V>> memory)
 *
 * MMType::UserManaged
 * Indicates the user managed memory manager is to be used.
 * This memory manager will never allocate or free memory. All memory operations are up to the programmer to
 * define within tasks. This memory manager acts as a throttling mechanism to ensure an ITask will not allocate
 * beyond the specified pool size.
 * To create this edge use the TaskGraph::addUserManagedMemoryManagerEdge() function
 * To check if memory is ready to be allocated use ITask::allocUserManagedMemory<type>(std::string name)
 * To release memory use ITask::memRelease(std::string name, int pipelineId)
 * The pipeline ID associated with a piece of memory should be attributed to the ITask that calls ITask::allocUserManagedMemory.
 * If this is not carefully managed within an ExecutionPipeline, then deadlock can be encountered.
