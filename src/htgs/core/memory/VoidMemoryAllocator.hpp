 * @brief Special allocator for user-managed memory managers.
 * @details
 * This class is internally used only when a user-managed memory manager is created.
 * Effectively, the memory allocated is nullptr and has no functionality for freeing the memory.
 * Doing so allows the memory manager to act as a throttling mechanism for memory managed by the user.
 * @note This class should only be called by the HTGS API
