/**
 * @class Connector Connector.hpp <htgs/core/graph/Connector.hpp>
 * @brief Manages the input/output of IData between Tasks.
 * @details
 * Each IData that is produced for the Connector is inserted based on
 * the priority specified by the IData (lowest order value first by default IData::getOrder()).
 *
 * The Connector manages how many Tasks are producing and consuming data for a particular Connector.
 * For a given ITask, if that ITask has more than one thread associated with it, then each thread
 * acts as a separate producer for the Connector. The Connector will not indicate it has
 * finished producing data until all producers have indicated that they have finished.
 *
 * If a data stream is producing data outside of a TaskGraph, then that stream must indicate it is
 * an InputTask otherwise the ITask associated with this Connector may terminate prior to processing data.
 * By incrementing the input task count, will ensure the Connector stays open for an ITask until the stream
 * producing data indicates it has finished. To increment the input Task count use incrementInputTaskCount() and
 * to indicate the input has finished producing data use producerFinished().
 *
 * @tparam T the input/output data type for the Connector, T  must derive from IData.
 * @note This class should only be called by the HTGS API
