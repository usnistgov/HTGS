/**
* @class IData IData.hpp <htgs/api/IData.hpp>
* @brief Class to hold any type of data.
*
* @details Defines custom types of data that is used for data entering/leaving task graphs.
* All task's input and output types must derive from IData. Once derived a child of IData can
* store any type of data.
*
* One common usage is to store MemoryData within IData to be passed between tasks and released
* later.
*
* Ordering can be used to specify the order of a task's priority queue (lowest value is first).
*
* (Optional) You can customize the ordering to your specifications by overriding the following function:
* @code
* virtual bool compare(const std::shared_ptr<IData> p2) const
* @endcode
*
*
* Example implementation:
* @code
*
* class MatrixData : public htgs::IData {
* public:
*  MatrixData(int order, double * matrix, int matrixSize) : IData(order), matrix(matrix), matrixSize(matrixSize)
*  {}
*
* // (optional) Reverses the default ordering
* virtual bool compare(const std::shared_ptr<IData> p2) const {
*   return this->getOrder() < p2.getOrder();
* }
*
* private:
*  double *matrix;
*  int matrixSize;
*
* };
* @endcode
