/**
 * @class IMemoryAllocator IMemoryAllocator.hpp <htgs/api/IMemoryAllocator.hpp>
 * @brief Abstract class that describes how memory is allocated and freed
 *
 * @details
 * This class is used in conjunction with TaskGraph::addMemoryManagerEdge and is required
 * in order to define how a MemoryManager allocates memory for its memory pool.
 *
 * Example implementation:
 * @code
 * class FFTWMemoryAllocator : public htgs::IMemoryAllocator<fftw_complex *>
 * {
 *   FFTWMemoryAllocator(size_t size) : IMemoryAllocator(size) {}
 *
 *   virtual fftw_complex *memAlloc(size_t size) {
 *     return fftw_alloc_complex(size);
 *   }
 *
 *   virtual fftw_complex *memAlloc() {
 *   	return fftw_alloc_complex(this->size());
 *   }
 *
 *   virtual void memFree(fftw_complex *&memory) {
 *     fftw_free(memory);
 *   }
 *
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * int memoryPoolSize = 50;
 * FFTTask *fftTask = new FFTTask();
 * MatMulTask *matMul = new MatMulTask();
 *
 * htgs::TaskGraph<FFTData, VoidData> *taskGraph = new htgs::TaskGraph();
 *
 * taskGraph->addEdge(fftTask, matMul);
 *
 * taskGraph->addMemoryManagerEdge("fft", fftTask, matMul, new FFTWMemoryAllocator(imgSize), memoryPoolSize);
 * @endcode
 * @tparam T the memory type
